  \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for the \TeX{}
  typesetting program. \textbf{It offers programmable desktop
  \textit{publishing features and extensive facilities for
  automating most aspects of \underline{typesetting and desktop}}
  publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing,
  tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies, and
  much more}. \LaTeX{} was originally written in 1984 by
  Leslie Lamport and has become the dominant method for
  using \TeX; few people write in plain \TeX{} anymore.
  The current version is \LaTeXe.

  % The following shows typesetting power of LaTeX:
  \begin{align}
    E_0 &= mc^2                              \\
    E &= \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \end{align}
